# Data Governance & Access Control Workshop with Immuta


## **Introduction**

Welcome to the Immuta Hands-On Lab for Amazon Redshift!

Throughout this lab, you will work through a realistic scenario and learn how to use Immuta to automate data access and control by constructing policies using Immuta's advanced policy engine.  Immuta integrates directly with Redshift so it has very low overhead and can frequently even **improve query performance**. 

This Lab is divided into ***4 Modules,*** each should take about ***15-20 minutes.***  

**As you complete each module, you will learn :**

1. How Administrators manage users, metadata, and configure <u>Immuta</u> to **connect to Redshift** 

2. How Immuta <u>Global Subscription Policies</u> can **control access** to a sensitive dataset

3. How Immuta <u>Global Data Policies</u> are able to have fine-grained control over **column masking** and **row filtering**

4. How Immuta's Discussions, Projects, and Notifications features streamline change management, escalation and collaboration



**What is Immuta?**

The Immuta platform solves two of the largest issues facing data-driven organizations: access and governance. In large organizations, it can be difficult, if not impossible, for data scientists to access all the data they need. Once they do get access, it’s often difficult to make sure they use the data in ways that are compliant with regulations.

The Immuta platform solves both problems by providing a unifying layer for data and policy across an organization and ensuring that all restrictions placed on data are dynamically enforced through the native data platforms. This unification creates efficiency and provides complete visibility of policy enforcement and monitoring.

Immuta dynamically protects your data with appropriate policy enforcement no matter how complex the policies are.  They can be based on the user accessing the data, their attributes, or their intended purpose. No other product provides the same level of control and confidence, especially while data usecases and data users proliferate.

| **What are Immuta's key Features and Benefits** |
| ----------------------------------------------- |

**Attribute-Based Access Control**:

Immuta’s policy builder empowers data teams to create automated policies to govern cloud data use – scaling user adoption, eliminating approval bottlenecks, and providing trust with compliance and governance teams.

**Discovery & Classification**:

Immuta automatically scans cloud data sources, detects sensitive data, and generates standard tagging across multiple compute platforms, reducing risk and improving data utility.

**Policy Enforcement & Auditing**:

Immuta enforces access control policies automatically on every query, and captures rich audit logs so data teams can be confident data is used securely, and can prove compliance with rules and regulations.

**Masking & Anonymization**:

Immuta’s advanced privacy-enhancing technologies (PETS) accelerate data sharing use cases by dynamically masking and anonymizing sensitive data, and are supported by Immuta’s expert team of legal engineers.

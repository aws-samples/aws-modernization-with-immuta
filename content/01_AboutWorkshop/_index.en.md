## **Use Case**

- ABC Corp sells Body-Heat â„¢ an iPhone accessory that captures body warmth to keep your phone charged and also tracks your temperature as a health signal.  ABC has been selling directly to consumers via their website but also wants to market and sell them through a distribution network of 3rd party brick & mortar retailers.

- To support this strategy, ABC Corp wants to increase its ability to make data available internally and externally. It also wants to tightly control, secure and audit access to sensitive and protected data.

- The Chief Data Officer (CDO) just joined ABC Corp 2 months ago. At her previous company she has seen how Immuta works to simplify & solve this very hard problem. In fact, at her previous company, they were able to accelerate use of cloud-based workloads from 25% to 100% once Immuta was implemented for secure access for all the various types of workloads and datasets. 

- She has asked you to setup Immuta and evaluate whether it can work to manage access to ABC's wealth of historical Credit Card transaction data. She has a number of existing and new usecases in mind:  routine reporting and analytics, support for the new retail strategy, and fraud escalations. 

- Longer term, she wants to be able to explore and productionalize innovative data science initiatives at ABC Corp.

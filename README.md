## Data Governance & Access Control Workshop with Immuta

Welcome to the Immuta Hands-On Lab for Amazon Redshift!

Throughout this lab, you will learn work through a realistic scenario and learn how to use Immuta to automate data access and control by constructing policies using Immuta’s advanced policy engine. Immuta integrates directly with Redshift so it has very low overhead and can frequently even improve query performance.

This Lab is divided into 4 sections, each should take about 15-20 minutes.

What you will learn in each module:

- How Administrators manage users, metadata, and configure Immuta to connect to Redshift

- How Immuta Global Subscription Policies can control access to a sensitive dataset

- How Immuta Global Data Policies are able to have fine-grained control over column masking and row filtering

- How Immuta, Discussions, Projects, and Notifications streamline escalation and collaboration


**What is Immuta?**

The Immuta platform solves two of the largest issues facing data-driven organizations: access and governance. In large organizations, it can be difficult, if not impossible, for data scientists to access all the data they need. Once they do get access, it’s often difficult to make sure they use the data in ways that are compliant with regulations.

The Immuta platform solves both problems by providing a single, unified access point for data across an organization and ensuring that all restrictions placed on data are dynamically enforced through the platform. This unification creates efficient digital data exchanges and provides complete visibility of policy enforcement and monitoring.

Immuta provides a consistent point of access for all data analysis and dynamically protects your data with complex policies – enforced based on the user accessing the data and the logic of the policy – creating efficient digital data exchanges compliant with organizations' regulations with complete visibility of policy enforcement.
